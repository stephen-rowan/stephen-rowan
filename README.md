## 🐝 Philosophy

> “Those who have handled sciences have been either men of experiment or men of dogmas.  
> The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance.  
> But the bee takes a middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own.  
> Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy…”  
> — *Francis Bacon*
